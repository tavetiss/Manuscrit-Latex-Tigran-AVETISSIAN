abstract = {Interdisciplinary projects combining biomedical and electrical engineering pose an interesting opportunity for today's society. In the future, more and more people will have to rely on wearable devices to monitor and understand biological variables. One of the most key challenges is the design of wearable devices that operate reliably and autonomously for long periods using small batteries. In this paper, we present the design of a novel smart hearing aid for stutterers in which an event-driven architecture is used to minimize power consumption, and onboard processing and actuators help the user to stop stuttering. The design has been implemented using a novel Ambiq Apollo 2 Blue processor, which includes a 5.0 Bluetooth interface with the lowest power consumption on the market and tested in the field. The microcontroller performs the data analyses directly onboard actuating a speaker to help the user when needed. Experimental results show that our solution can last for up to 8 days on a single charge due to its low average power consumption of 1.5 mW during continuous operation, that is reduced to 832 $\mu$W in idle.},

abstract = {A system-on-chip for an invisible, fully-implantable cochlear implant is presented. Implantable acoustic sensing is achieved by interfacing the SoC to a piezoelectric sensor that detects the sound-induced motion of the middle ear. Measurements from human cadaveric ears demonstrate that the sensor can detect sounds between 40 and 90 dB SPL over the speech bandwidth. A highly-reconfigurable digital sound processor enables system power scalability by reconfiguring the number of channels, and provides programmable features to enable a patient-specific fit. A mixed-signal arbitrary waveform neural stimulator enables energy-optimal stimulation pulses to be delivered to the auditory nerve. The energy-optimal waveform is validated with in-vivo measurements from four human subjects which show a 15% to 35% energy saving over the conventional rectangular waveform. Prototyped in a 0.18 $\mu$m high-voltage CMOS technology, the SoC in 8-channel mode consumes 572 $\mu$W of power including stimulation. The SoC integrates implantable acoustic sensing, sound processing, and neural stimulation on one chip to minimize the implant size, and proof-of-concept is demonstrated with measurements from a human cadaver ear.},

@article{Brazier1927,
abstract = {It is a generally appreciated deduction from St. Venant's solution of the flexure problem that a beam in which the material is disposed at a distance from the neutral axis is superior to the solid section in economy of material. St. Yenant's solution, however, suggests that this advantage increases without limit as the thickness of the material is reduced and the distance from the neutral axis is increased. It has, of course, been generally realised that this conclusion is not supported by ordinary engineering practice, and recent experience in the use of high tensile steels and problems of aircraft structure have emphasised the desirability of a further examination of the flexure problem. St. Venant's solutions are obtained when the equations of equilibrium of an isotropic elastic solid are made linear by the neglect of terms of higher orders than the first: and by Kirchhoff's theorem of determinancy these solutions may then be considered unique and stable. To attack problems of stability it is necessary, as is shown by R. V. Southwell in his ‘General Theory of Elastic Stability,' to include some of the second order effects. It is, in fact, only when these become considerable that Kirchhoff's theorem fails and instability becomes possible. By this general treatment various classes of instability are obtained or indicated, but the only ones susceptible to analysis or of practical interest (on account of the “elastic limit” which is a feature of all practical materials) are those in which at the moment of instability the strains are still small. Bryant has shown that this will only occur, as in the case of thin rods and shells, when one dimension of the body is small compared with others.},

abstract = {The present paper examines instabilities of long thin elastic tubes. Both initially straight and initially bent tubes are analyzed under in-plane bending. Tube response, a combination of ovalization instability and bifurcation instability (buckling), is investigated using a nonlinear finite element (FE) technique, which employs polynomial functions in the longitudinal tube direction and trigonometric functions to describe cross-sectional deformation. It is demonstrated that the interaction between the two instability modes depends on the value and the sign of the initial tube curvature. The ovalization of initially bent tubes is examined in detail and, in particular, the case of opening moments. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes on bifurcation instability. It is shown that buckling may occur prior to or beyond the ovalization limit point, depending on the value of the initial curvature. Using the nonlinear FE formulation, the location of bifurcation on the primary path is detected, post-buckling equilibrium paths are traced, and the corresponding wave-lengths of the buckled configurations are calculated. Moreover, results over a wide range of initial curvature values are presented, extending the findings of previous works. Finally, several analytical approaches, introduced in previous research works, are also employed to estimate the moments causing ovalization and bifurcation instability. These approaches are based on nonlinear flexible shell theory or simplified ring analysis. The efficiency and accuracy of those analytical methods with respect to the nonlinear FE formulation are examined. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents further experimental investigations into axial compression of thin-walled circular tubes, a classical problem studied for several decades. A total of 70 quasi-static tests were conducted on circular 6060 aluminium tubes in the T5, as-received condition. The range of D/t considered was expanded over previous studies to D/t=10-450. Collapse modes were observed for L/D ≤ 10 and a mode classification chart developed. The average crush force, FAV, was non-dimensionalised and an empirical formula established as FAV/MP = 72.3(D/t)0.32. It was found that test results for both axi-symmetric and non-symmetric modes lie on a single curve. Comprehensive comparisons have been made between existing theories and our test results for FAV. This has revealed some shortcomings, suggesting that further theoretical work may be required. It was found that the ratio of FMAX/FAV increased substantially with an increase in the D/t ratio. The effect of filling aluminium tubes with different density polyurethane foam was also briefly examined. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the most critical issues. WSNs are conventionally battery operated sensor nodes which have short lifetime due to limited battery power and replacement of battery regularly is a costly and complicated task. Furthermore, in case of Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN), the problem arises due to its increasing cost and being uncomfortable in some cases (where replacement takes place). Energy harvesting is one of the solutions for any wireless network. There are several novel methods to generate energy from the environmental sources such as wind, solar, vibration, biological, and chemical. Besides these conventional sources, human body, with its many intended and unintended activities, is another source of energy. And it offers a reasonable solution to the issue in terms of renewable energy. Based upon appropriate power consumption from different harvesting methods, they can be used in a better way of required application. Human energy expenditure from different activities and how do we use that energy as electric sources and their power consumptions have been discussed here. The demand of a healthcare monitoring network with long life without replacement is also resolved by energy harvesting technologies. Here, first we have presented reviews on methods of energy harvesting techniques through human activities and, second, those technologies then would be used for biological applications (healthcare applications) as well as consumer electronics. Among all possible way of harvesting technologies (kinetic energy, biological fuel cell, and thermal energy), piezoelectric harvester technology becomes more appropriate model for powering sensors in biomedical implants, because it delivers tens of $\mu$W to few mW of power which fulfill the criteria of powering the sensor nodes. Adopting an advanced synchronized switched harvester on inductor (SSHI) makes the energy harvester more efficient and stable device. It gives a stable output and removes low voltage start-up problem and a good controller piezoelectric energy harvester. A brief comparison of various available energy harvesting technology and their power consumption for extending the battery lifetime has been presented.},

Most research is focused on a particular technology, and it is often difficult to compare widely differing designs and approaches to vibration-based energy harvesting. The aim of this study is to provide a general theory that can be used to compare different approaches and designs for vibration-based generators. Estimates of maximum theoretical power density based on a range of commonly occurring vibrations, measured by the author, are presented. Estimates range from 0.5 to 100mW/cm3 for vibrations in the range of 1-10 m/s2 at 50-350 Hz. The theory indicates that, in addition to the parameters of the input vibrations, power output depends on the system coupling coefficient, the quality factor of the device, the mass density of the generator, and the degree to which the electrical load maximizes power transmission. An expression for effectiveness that incorporates all of these factors is developed. The general theory is applied to electromagnetic, piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, and electrostatic transducer technologies. Finally, predictions from the general theory are compared to experimental results from two piezoelectric vibration generator designs. {\textcopyright} 2005 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {Implantable medical devices usually require a battery to operate and this can represent a severe restriction. In most cases, the implantable medical devices must be surgically replaced because of the dead batteries; therefore, the longevity of the whole implantable medical device is determined by the battery lifespan. For this reason, researchers have been studying energy harvesting techniques from the human body in order to obtain batteryless implantable medical devices. The human body is a rich source of energy and this energy can be harvested from body heat, breathing, arm motion, leg motion or the motion of other body parts produced during walking or any other activity. In particular, the main human-body energy sources are kinetic energy and thermal energy. This paper reviews the state-of-art in kinetic and thermoelectric energy harvesters for powering implantable medical devices. Kinetic energy harvesters are based on electromagnetic, electrostatic and piezoelectric conversion. The different energy harvesters are analyzed highlighting their sizes, energy or power they produce and their relative applications. As they must be implanted, energy harvesting devices must be limited in size, typically about 1 cm 3. The available energy depends on human-body positions; therefore, some positions are more advantageous than others. For example, favorable positions for piezoelectric harvesters are hip, knee and ankle where forces are significant. The energy harvesters here reported produce a power between 6 nW and 7.2 mW; these values are comparable with the supply requirements of the most common implantable medical devices; this demonstrates that energy harvesting techniques is a valid solution to design batteryless implantable medical devices. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Efficient and uninterrupted operation of the implanted biomedical devices such as Cochlear implants demand integrated energy harvester. MEMS based piezoelectric energy harvesters are a potential solution. In a Cochlear implant the harvester has to be placed on the eardrum which vibrates as the sound waves enter the ear. If the frequency of the vibration of the eardrum matches with the resonant frequency of the energy harvester, it generates maximum voltage output which can be used to power the battery of the Cochlear implant. In this paper a novel energy harvester is designed with bio-compatible Zinc Oxide thin film (thickness 2 $\mu$m) as the piezoelectric material. The harvester is in the shape of a tapered cantilever beam with a proof mass to reduce the resonant frequency. Moreover, a perforation has been implemented on the cantilever beam in a suitable position to further reduce the resonant frequency and to increase the voltage output without increasing the length of the cantilever. The achieved resonant frequency of the final proposed structure is 126 Hz. The voltage obtained is 0.75 V at an acceleration of 0.1g at the resonant frequency. The proposed structure can be fitted easily on the eardrum and used to generate voltage from the vibration of the eardrum caused by incoming sound waves and can replace the need of recharging the battery in the Cochlear implants.},

Mechanical vibrations prove to be a reliable energy source, but low-frequency broadband vibrations cannot be harvested effectively using linear oscillators. This article discusses an alternative for harvesting such vibrations, with energy harvesters with two stable configurations. The challenges related to nonlinear dynamics are briefly discussed. Different existing designs of bistable energy harvesters are presented and classified, according to their feasibility for miniaturization. A general dynamic model for those designs is described. Finally, an extensive discussion on quantitative measures of evaluating the effectiveness of energy harvesters is accomplished, resulting in the proposition of a new dimensionless metric suited for a broadband analysis. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are highly attractive as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their superior theoretical capacity, low cost and environmental compatibility. Nevertheless, the low utilization of active materials and detrimental shuttle reactions severely inhibit the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a lightweight 2D boron doped g-C3N4 nanosheets (BCN) with abundant active sites and increased conductivity prepared by a facile route is introduced onto commercial separators to achieve high performance Li-S batteries. The prepared BCN displays a 2D thin layer nanosheet structure with a thickness of ～2.5 nm. The boron doping not only can increase surface area and improve electrical conductivity, but also chemically anchor more polysulfides due to the formed B-N bond, which can effectively minimize the shuttling of polysulfides through the synergistic effect of physical yield and chemical confinement. As a result, the assembled Li-S batteries employing BCN separators with multifunction display large discharge capacity of 1197 mAh g−1, high sulfur utilization and outstanding durability with a capacity decay rate of 0.09% per cycle at 1 C after 500 cycles, which are also supported by the density functional theory simulation. Additionally, the alleviated self-discharge behavior and good areal capacity (up to 6.4 mAh cm−2) at a high sulfur loading of the cell are also demonstrated. The exploration of BCN modified separator furnishes a viable way to construct high energy density and long lifespan Li-S batteries.},

abstract = {Hydraulic shock absorbers have been widely used to dissipate kinetic energy of the shocks into surrounding environment. By employing oscillatory motion to drive power generator, the shock energy can be converted into electricity for harvesting. However, the frequent bidirectional oscillation of the generator can cause a large impact force. This further leads to deteriorated energy harvesting performance, moving parts fatigue, and even system failure. As such, this study introduces four check values to form a hydraulic rectifier to integrate the shock absorption and energy harvesting functionalities. The bidirectional oscillation of the shock and the vibration is converted into unidirectional rotation to drive the generator. Following the proposed concept, a prototype energy-harvesting shock absorber has been designed and fabricated. An electromechanical model has also been developed to examine the response behavior of the prototype device. The prototype performance has been characterized based on the experimental results from three test setups. Both mechanical and electrical parameters of the electromechanical model have been identified based on our cyclic loading experiments. The results have shown that the developed energy-harvesting shock absorber is capable of harvesting the energy and absorbing the shock simultaneously. In our experiments, a maximum of 248.8 W instantaneous power (a maximum of 114.1 W on average) has been captured and a maximum of 38.81% energy harvesting efficiency has been achieved via harmonic excitation with an amplitude of 8 mm and a frequency of 2 Hz, when the load resistance is tuned to 7.5 $\Omega$.},

abstract = {The problem of inelastic bending and collapse of tubes in the presence of internal pressure is investigated using experiments and analyses. The experiments involve 1.5-inch diameter, D/t=52 stainless steel tubes bent to failure at fixed values of pressure. The moment-curvature response is governed by the inelastic characteristics of the material. Bending induces some ovalization to the tube cross section while, simultaneously, the internal pressure causes the circumference to grow. Following some inelastic deformation, small amplitude axial wrinkles appear on the compressed side of the tube, and their amplitude grows stably as bending progresses. Eventually, wrinkling localizes, causing catastrophic failure usually in the form of an outward bulge. Internal pressure stabilizes the structure, it increases the wavelength of the wrinkles and can increase significantly the curvature at collapse. The onset of wrinkling is established by a custom bifurcation buckling formulation. The evolution of wrinkling and its eventual localization are simulated successfully using a FE shell model. The material is represented as an anisotropic elastic-plastic solid using the flow theory, while the models are assigned initial geometric imperfections with the wavelength of the wrinkling bifurcation mode. It is demonstrated that successful prediction of collapse requires very accurate representation of the material inelastic properties including yield anisotropies, and that as expected, the collapse curvature is sensitive to the imperfection amplitude and wavelength imposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising technology that powers the electronic devices via scavenging the ambient energy. Piezoelectric energy harvesters have attracted considerable interest for their high conversion efficiency and easy fabrication in minimized sensors and transducers. To improve the output capability of energy harvesters, properties of piezoelectric materials is an influential factor, but the potential of the material is less likely to be fully exploited without an optimized configuration. In this paper, an optimization strategy for PVDF-based cantilever-type energy harvesters is proposed to achieve the highest output power density with the given frequency and acceleration of the vibration source. It is shown that the maximum power output density only depends on the maximum allowable stress of the beam and the working frequency of the device, and these two factors can be obtained by adjusting the geometry of piezoelectric layers. The strategy is validated by coupled finite-element-circuit simulation and a practical device. The fabricated device within a volume of 13.1 mm3 shows an output power of 112.8 $\mu$W which is comparable to that of the best-performing piezoceramic-based energy harvesters within the similar volume reported so far.},

The harvester adopts a nonlinear snap-through buckling configuration and two piezoelectric transducers, placed near the inflection points of the potential energy function that underpins the dynamics of the system. The device is capable of scavenging energy from vibration sources in the range of 0.5-7 Hz, but could be exploited up to 10 Hz with an acceptable loss of efficiency. The bandwidth of the device is compatible with applications where the vibrations occur at low frequencies, e.g., in the case of a running human. Powers of about 416 µW with root-mean-square accelerations of 13.35 m/s 2 at 7 Hz and an efficiency of about 24.6% have been measured in case of a sinusoidal vibration while powers of about 250 µW and an efficiency of about 15.7%, have been measured in case of a noise input limited at 15 Hz, with a standard deviation of the accelerations of about 15.1 m/s 2. The performance of the harvester is compared with a different configuration where the piezoelectric transducers are placed at the two minima of the (bistable) potential energy function that underpins the dynamics; the minima correspond to the stable states of the beam.},

abstract = {Kinetic energy harvesting has drawn great attention in the past decade, but low-frequency and broadband operation is still a big issue which impedes this technology to be widely deployed in low-power Internet of Things applications. In this paper, theoretical modelling and experimental validation of a rotational harvester with bi-stability and frequency up-conversion is presented for harnessing low-frequency kinetic energy with a wide bandwidth. Piezoelectric transduction was adopted to convert the rotational kinetic energy into electricity. Distributed-parameter modelling was employed for analyzing the electromechanical dynamics of the bistable piezoelectric beam. Bistable and frequency up-converting behaviours were considered in the theoretical model by introducing two external input magnetic forces. Different oscillating modes were analyzed, showing the variation of power generation capability under different modes, and the advantage of operating in the periodic double-well mode. From the potential well study, we got a conclusion that for the same input magnetic force, periodic double-well mode is capable of achieving a larger vibration amplitude compared to a harvester without bi-stability. Asymmetric potential well shapes were investigated. This asymmetric shape provides a way to stabilize the initiation position of the beam for each plucking cycle, and eventually to stabilized the output. Key design factors to control the oscillating modes were studied, providing a guideline for future design. An experimental study was conducted to verify the theoretical results. A close match was achieved. This bistable harvester demonstrated a significant improvement (up to 2×) compared to a harvester without bi-stability over a wide bandwidth (from 1 to 11 Hz) at low frequencies, when operating in the periodic double-well mode. This paper presents a detailed theoretical model and in-depth analysis of a bistable frequency up-converting harvester, providing a fundamental understanding and guidance for low-frequency broadband energy harvester design.},

abstract = {The study of energy harvesting by means of vortex induced vibration systems has been initiated a few years ago and it is considered to be potential as a low water current energy source. The energy harvester is realized by exposing an elastically supported blunt structure under water flow. However, it is realized that the system will only perform at a limited operating range (water flow) that is attributed to the resonance phenomenon that occurs only at a frequency that corresponds to the fluid flow. An introduction of nonlinear elements seems to be a prominent solution to overcome the problem. Among many nonlinear elements, a bistable spring is known to be able to improve the harvested power by a vortex induced vibrations (VIV) based energy converter at the low velocity water flows. However, it is also observed that chaotic vibrations will occur at different operating ranges that will erratically diminish the harvested power and cause a difficulty in controlling the system that is due to the unpredictability in motions of the VIV structure. In order to design a bistable VIV energy converter with improved harvested power and minimum negative effect of chaotic vibrations, the bifurcation map of the system for varying governing parameters is highly on demand. In this study, chaotic vibrations of a VIV energy converter enhanced by a bistable stiffness element are quantified in a wide range of the governing parameters, i.e. damping and bistable gap. Chaotic vibrations of the bistable VIV energy converter are simulated by utilization of a wake oscillator model and quantified based on the calculation of the Lyapunov exponent. Ultimately, a series of experiments of the system in a water tunnel, facilitated by a computer-based force-feedback testing platform, is carried out to validate the existence of chaotic responses. The main challenge in dealing with experimental data is in distinguishing chaotic response from noise-contaminated periodic responses as noise will smear out the regularity of periodic responses. For this purpose, a surrogate data test is used in order to check the hypotheses for the presence of chaotic behavior. The analyses from the experimental results support the hypothesis from simulation that chaotic response is likely occur on the real system.},

@article{Kulah2008,
abstract = {This paper presents an electromagnetic (EM) vibration-to-electrical power generator for wireless sensors, which can scavenge energy from low-frequency external vibrations. For most wireless applications, the ambient vibration is generally at very low frequencies (1–100 Hz), and traditional scavenging techniques cannot generate enough energy for proper operation. The reported generator up-converts low-frequency environmental vibrations to a higher frequency through a mechanical frequency up-converter using a magnet, and hence provides more efficient energy conversion at low frequencies. Power is generated by means of EM induction using a magnet and coils on top of resonating cantilever beams. The proposed approach has been demonstrated using a macroscale version, which provides 170 nW maximum power and 6 mV maximum voltage. For the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) version, the expected maximum power and maximum voltage from a single cantilever is 3.97 $\mu$W and 76 mV, respectively, in vacuum. Power level can be increased further by using series-connected cantilevers without increasing the overall generator area, which is 4 mm2. This system provides more than an order of magnitude better energy conversion for 10–100 Hz ambient vibration range, compared to a conventional large mass/coil system. {\textcopyright} 2008, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

@article{Pillatsch2012,
abstract = {Harvesting energy from low-frequency and non-harmonic excitations typical of human motion presents specific challenges. While resonant devices do have an advantage in environments where the excitation frequency is constant, and while they can make use of the entire proof mass travel range in the case of excitation amplitudes that are smaller than the internal displacement limit, they are not suitable for body applications since the frequencies are random and the amplitudes tend to be larger than the device size. In this paper a piezoelectric, impulse-excited approach is presented. A cylindrical proof mass actuates an array of piezoelectric bi-morph beams through magnetic attraction. After the initial excitation these transducers are left to vibrate at their natural frequency. This increases the operational frequency range as well as the electromechanical coupling. The principle of impulse excitation is discussed and a centimetre-scale functional model is introduced as a proof of concept. The obtained data show the influence of varying the frequency, acceleration and proof mass. Finally, a commercially available integrated circuit for voltage regulation is tested. At a frequency of 2Hz and an acceleration of 2.7ms 2 a maximal power output of 2.1mW was achieved. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

CochlEEG features high sampling rates, up to 4 kHz, low-noise signal acquisitions, support for active electrodes, and a potential for Wi-Fi data transmission. Moreover, it is lightweight, pocket size, and affordable, which makes CochlEEG suitable for wearable and real-world applications. The efficiency of CochlEEG in EEG data acquisition is also investigated in this paper. Auditory steady-state responses acquisition results validate CochlEEG's capability in recording EEG with a signal quality comparable to commercial mobile or research EEG acquisition devices. Moreover, the results of an oddball paradigm experiment prove the capability of CochlEEG in recording event-related potentials and demonstrate its potential for brain-computer interface applications and electrophysiological research applications requiring higher temporal resolution.},

abstract = {A novel magnetically levitated linear actuator, mainly consisting of a Halbach magnetized moving-magnet armature, a cylindrical frame, a rod, and electromagnetic poles, is presented and analyzed for linear compressors applications. The Halbach magnetized armature naturally generates a periodically distributed magnetic field, which is interacted with that induced by the electromagnetic poles. Therefore, an axially reciprocating thrust force is induced that is inherently suitable for high-frequency drive for linear compressors. A lateral magnetic repulsive force, due to the eddy current induced at the cylindrical frame, to exert upon the rod is generated as long as the rod is deviated in the radial direction. Once the position of the rod is laterally deviated from the central position, the rod is automatically brought back by this magnetic repulsive force. The magnetic field distributions, axial thrust force, and lateral magnetic repulsive force are numerically obtained by governing equations analysis under the cylindrical coordinate. The finite element method, by the commercial software ANSOFT Maxwell with Transient Solver (Ansoft Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), is employed to be compared with and validate the solutions obtained by the governing equations analysis. It is shown that the governing equations analysis extremely agrees with the results by the finite element method. At last, the efficacy of the proposed magnetically levitated linear actuator is examined and verified by intensive computer simulations and experiments. CN - 16},

abstract = {As part of an ongoing effort to develop a micro-scale gas turbine engine for power generation and micropropulsion applications, this paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental assessment of a catalytic combustion system. Previous work has indicated that homogenous gas-phase microcombustors are severely limited by chemical reaction time-scales. Storable hydrocarbon fuels, such as propane, have been shown to blowout well below the desired mass flow rate per unit volume. Heterogeneous catalytic combustion has been identified as a possible improvement. Surface catalysis can increase hydrocarbon-air reaction rates, improve ignition characteristics, and broaden stability limits. Several radial inflow combustors were micromachined from silicon wafers using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) and aligned fusion wafer bonding. The 191 mm3 combustion chambers were filled with platinum coated foam materials of various porosity and surface area. For near stoichiometric propane-air mixtures, exit gas temperatures of 1100 K were achieved at mass flow rates in excess of 0.35 g/s. This corresponds to a power density of approximately 1200 MW/m3; an 8.5-fold increase over the maximum power density achieved for gas-phase propane-air combustion in a similar geometry. Low order models including time-scale analyses and a one-dimensional steady-state plugflow reactor model, were developed to elucidate the underlying physics and to identify important design parameters. High power density catalytic microcombustors were found to be limited by the diffusion of fuel species to the active surface, while substrate porosity and surface area-to-volume ratio were the dominant design variables.},

The compressor was designed for application in a ﬁst-sized gas-turbine-generator. To survive high stresses at such high temperatures, the rotor was manufactured as a single turbine/compressor/shaft unit in silicon nitride, by the Mold SDM process. Performance testing was conducted in a cold-ﬂow rig at reduced speed of 420,000 rpm. Results from a CFD code compared favorably to measured data at this speed. Extrapolation from test conditions to full design speed was accomplished by application of CFD applied at both speeds.},

abstract = {Many of the distinctive and useful phenomena of soft matter come from its interaction with interfaces. Examples are the peeling of a strip of adhesive tape, the coating of a surface, the curling of a fiber via capillary forces, or the collapse of a porous sponge. These interfacial phenomena are distinct from the intrinsic behavior of a soft material like a gel or a microemulsion. Yet many forms of interfacial phenomena can be understood via common principles valid for many forms of soft matter. Our goal in organizing this school was to give students a grasp of these common principles and their many ramifications and possibilities. The Les Houches Summer School comprised over fifty 90-minute lectures over four weeks. Four four-lecture courses by Howard Stone, Michael Cates, David Nelson and L. Mahadevan served as an anchor for the program. A number of shorter courses and seminars rounded out the school. This volume collects the lecture notes of the school.},

This analysis and simulation enable a micro Stirling engine with an approximately 0.05cm 3 piston swept volume (equivalent to the displacement of a gasoline engine) to be produced. The output power is approximately 10 mW at 10 Hz. Problems of scaling down the engine to a maximum length of several millimeters are discussed.},

@article{Boldea2003,
abstract = {Linear electromagnetic actuators develop directly thrust and thus linear motion. In principle rotary motion electromagnetic motors may be turned into their linear counterparts by cutting them axially and spreading them in a plane. Rotary electromagnetic motors are predominant in industry but linear electromagnetic motors (actuators) are increasingly getting ground for linear industrial motion control. Typical applications are related to people movers (Fig. 1) whose acceleration and deceleration rates are freed from adherence and thus have lower deadweight per passenger; also they are almost maintenance free and easy to control them from on ground station; lower kWh per passenger and kilometer is obtained due to also full regenerative braking. Recent applications are related to industrial linear motion control with or without integrated magnetic suspension. While they are as many types of linear electromagnetic actuators as rotary ones, their control is also similar. So vector control and DTC is used for AC progressive motion linear electromagnetic actuators. Flux control may be used for suspension control. Fast action solenoids with or without PMs are proposed for valves actuation in internal combustion motors while conventional solenoids represent a mature and dynamic technology. Finally, oscillatory linear motion is used in linear generators and motors. Linear generators are driven by Stirling engines for space or home electricity generation and linear oscillomotors are proposed for small compressor drives. The paper reviews the principles, performance characteristics, design, control and recent applications of linear electric actuators. CN - 10},

@article{Walther2011,
abstract = {The miniaturization of electro-mechanical devices, and the resulting need for micro-power generation (milliwatts to watts) with low weight, long life devices, has lead to the recent development of the ﬁeld of micro-scale combustion and power generation. The primary objective of this new ﬁeld is to leverage the high energy density of fuels, speciﬁcally liquid hydrocarbon fuels relative to batteries and all other energy storage devices other than nuclear ﬁssion, fusion or decay. As such, a miniaturized device even with a moderately efﬁcient conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to power would result in increased lifetime and/or reduced weight of an electronic or mechanical system that are currently most often powered by electrochemical cells. Furthermore, improvements in this ﬁeld may make possible novel applications and/or capability. In addition to the interest in miniaturization, the ﬁeld is also driven by the potential fabrication of the devices using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or rapid prototyping techniques, with their favorable characteristics for mass production and/or low unit cost. The micro-power generation ﬁeld is very young, and still is in most cases in the feasibility stage. However, considering that it is a new frontier of technological development, and that only a few projects have been funded, it can be said that signiﬁcant progress has been made to date. Currently there is consensus, at least among those working in the ﬁeld, that combustion at the micro-scale is possible with proper thermal and chemical management. Several meso-scale and micro-scale combustors have been developed that appear to operate with good combustion efﬁciency. Some of these combustors have been applied to energize thermoelectric systems to produce power, although with low overall efﬁciency. Several turbines/engines have also been, or are being, developed, some of them currently producing positive power, albeit with low efﬁciency. Micro-rockets using solid or liquid fuels have been built and shown to produce thrust. More detailed scaling/modeling efforts are required to improve existing designs. Improvements in diagnostic, control and computational tools are expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the development of the ﬁeld. Some brief scaling arguments are given in this work, and more detailed efforts are referred. A brief introduction to several of the fabrication techniques is presented in this work. Hydrogen-based and some preliminary specialty fuel micro-fuel cells have been successfully developed, and there is a need to develop reliable reformers (or direct conversion fuel cells) for liquid hydrocarbons so that the fuel cells become competitive with the batteries. In this work, the technological issues related to micro-scale combustion and the development of thermochemical devices for power generation will be discussed. Some of the systems currently being developed will be presented, ongoing critical research issues under investigation, and other potential areas of development discussed. Comments regarding the opportunities and limitations of each of the techniques are also presented where applicable.},

abstract = {Engineering foundation for micro-turbomachinery aerothermal design, as an enabling element of the MIT micro-gas turbine technology, is developed. Fundamental differences between conventional, large scale and micro turbomachinery operation are delineated and the implications on design are discussed. These differences are largely a consequence of low operating Reynolds number, hence a relatively higher skin friction and heat transfer rate. While the size of the micro-gas turbine engine is ∼ a few mm, several order of magnitude smaller than conventional gas turbine, the required compressor stage pressure ratio (∼3–4) and impeller tip Mach number (∼1 and greater) are comparable; however, the disparity in the size implies that the operating Reynolds number of the micro-turbomachiery components is correspondingly several order of magnitudes smaller. Thus the design and operating requirements for micro-turbomachinery are distinctly different from those of conventional turbomachinery used for propulsion and power generation. Important distinctions are summarized in the following. 1. The high surface-to-flow rate ratio has the consequence that the flow in micro-compressor flow path can no longer be taken as adiabatic; the performance penalty associated with heat addition to compressor flow path from turbine is a primary performance limiting factor. 2. Endwall torque on the flow can be significant compared to that from the impeller blade surfaces so that direct use of Euler Turbine Equation is no longer appropriate. 3. Losses in turbine nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) can be one order of magnitude higher than those in conventional sized nozzle guide vanes. 4. The high level of kinetic energy in the flow exiting the turbine rotor is a source of performance penalty, largely a consequence of geometrical constraints. It can be inferred from these distinctions that standard preliminary design procedures based on the Euler equation, the adiabatic assumption, the loss correlations for large Reynolds numbers, and the three-dimensional geometry, are inapplicable to micro-turbomachinery. The preliminary design procedure, therefore, must account for these important differences. Characterization of the effects of heat addition on compressor performance, modification of Euler turbine equation for casing torque, characterization of turbine NGV performance and turbine exhaust effects are presented.},

abstract = {In Part I of this two-part paper, the design approach for a microturbopump was presented. This second part describes the fabrication and experimental characterization of the demo microturbopump device, which includes hydrostatic bearings, a spiral-groove viscous pump, and a multistage microturbine. The device is composed of five wafers: one glass wafer, one silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, and three silicon wafers. The silicon and SOI wafers are patterned using shallow and deep reactive ion etching (total of 14 masks), while the Pyrex glass wafer was ultrasonically drilled. Anodic bonding, fusion bonding, and manual assembly with alignment structures were then used to complete the device and enclose the 4-mm-diameter rotor. The approach allowed the microfabrication of unique interdigitated blade rows in the microturbine and interchangeable parts for flexible testing. After completion of the device, bearings were first tested in static and dynamic conditions. Then, the turbine was characterized with compressed air only and spun up to 330 000 r/min, producing 0.38 W of mechanical power. The pump performance map was also completely characterized for speeds up to 120 000 r/min, showing a maximum pump flow rate of 9 mg/s and maximum pressure rise of 240 kPa. In a turbopump system performance test using compressed air to the turbine and water in the pump, the rotor was spun up to 116 000 r/min, which corresponds to 25 m/s in tip speed. At this condition, the turbine produced 0.073 W of mechanical power with 41 kPa of differential pressure and 24 mg/s of flow rate, and the pump pressurized water by 88 kPa with a flow rate of 4 mg/s, maintaining constant efficiency of 7.2% over the operating range. Out of the total power produced by the turbine, 10% was consumed by the viscous pump, while the rest was dissipated by other components through viscous drag. The system-level predictions by models introduced in Part I also match the measured performance, suggesting that a valid design basis has been established for this type of rotating micromachine.},

To aim at more realistic values, the models have to take into account the heat losses and irreversibilities on the engine. An analytical model which encompasses the critical flaws of the regenerator and furthermore the heat exchangers effectivenesses has been developed. This model has been validated using the whole range of the experimental data available from the General Motor GPU-3 Stirling engine prototype. The effects of the technological and operating parameters on Stirling engine performance have been investigated. In addition to the regenerator influence, the effect of the cooler effectiveness is underlined.},

abstract = {A review is presented for the research development of Stirling cycle engines for recovering low and moderate temperature heat. The Stirling cycle engines are categorized into four types, including kinetic, thermoacoustic, free-piston, and liquid piston types. The working characteristics, features, technological details, and performances of the related Stirling cycle engines are summarized. Upon comparing the available experimental results and the technology potentials, the research directions and the possible applications of different Stirling cycle engines are further discussed and identiﬁed. It is concluded that kinetic Stirling engines and thermoacoustic engines have the greatest application prospect in low and moderate temperature heat recoveries in terms of output power scale, conversion efﬁciency, and costs. In particular, kinetic Stirling engines should be oriented toward two directions for practical applications, including providing low-cost solutions for low temperatures, and moderate efﬁcient solutions with moderate costs for medium temperatures. Thermoacoustic engines for low temperature applications are especially attractive due to their low costs, high efﬁciencies, superior reliabilities, and simplicities over the other mechanical Stirling engines. This work indicates that a cost effective Stirling cycle engine is practical for recovering small-scale distributed low-grade thermal energy from various sources.},

The rotor is required to rotate at 870 000 rpm to generate the compressor pressure ratio 3, and it has successfully been achieved by using hydroinertia gas bearings. A compressor efﬁciency higher than that required by the target cycle has been measured. After correcting the effect of the heat leakage, approximately 65% of the compressor adiabatic efﬁciency is estimated to be achievable. The combustor has achieved stable self-sustained combustion at a combustion efﬁciency higher than 99.9%. The heat conduction analysis based on measured data showed that it is possible to keep the compressor below 170 ◦C when the turbine inlet temperature is 1050 ◦C. All four requirements are proven to be achievable, and hence, the feasibility of the micro-scale gas turbine at an impeller of 10 mm diameter has successfully been proven at component level.},

abstract = {Major challenges of micro thermal machines are the thermal insulation and mechanical tolerance in the case of sliding piston. Replacing piston by membrane in microengines can alleviate the latter and lead to planar architectures. However, the thermal isolation would call for very thick structures which are associated to too high resonant frequencies which are detrimental to the engine performances. A thermal and mechanical compromise is to be made. On the contrary, based on fluid structure interaction, using an incompressible fluid contained in a cavity sealed by deformable diaphragm it would be possible to design a thick, low frequency insulating diaphragm. The design involves a simple planar geometry that is easy to manufacture with standard microelectronics methods. An analytical fluid-structure model is proposed and theoretically validated. Experimental structures are realized and tested. The model is in agreement with the experimental results. A dimensionless model is proposed to design hybrid fluid structures for micromachines.},

abstract = {The rapid progress in microelectromechanical system technology has facilitated great developments in micro heat engines, however, defects in these engines still need to be overcome. Thus, a novel four-stroke micro swing rotor engine (MSRE) that features the advantages of Wankel engine and the micro swing engine is proposed in this study. Kinematic and thermodynamic analyses of the MSRE were performed, and a preliminary experimental research was conducted. In the MSRE, the driver assembly was used to dominate the movements of the two rotors. By the design guideline adaptable to the engine operation principle, the volume of each chamber will vary in a sine-like waveform, which was validated by kinematic analyses. Then, a prototype in mesoscale was designed and fabricated. In consideration of the leakage effect, the thermodynamic characteristics of this engine were numerically investigated. Results indicate that the engine thermodynamic processes were seriously affected by leakage flow, especially when working at low frequencies. Gap height and operation frequency were the two dominant factors that affected engine performance. Under a certain gap height, the MSRE had to work at a specific frequency range and the corresponding optical values exist for engine efficiency and power. With a 20 &mu;m height, the MSRE reached the maximum efficiency of 23.62% at 55 Hz and the maximum power of 3442 W at 95 Hz. Feasibility of the engine was further verified by an experimental test on the operation characteristics, including the cold state test with pressured air blow and the combustion test for engine operation at thermal state. This research lays a good foundation for future development of MSRE, which is of great practical significance for the progress in micro power systems.},

abstract = {The demand for energy sources that are compact, lightweight and powerful has signiﬁcantly increased in recent years. Traditional chemical batteries which are highly developed are unable to meet the demand for high energy intensity. This gap is expected to widen in the future as electronic devices need more power to support enhanced functionalities. Hydrocarbon fuels have energy densities much greater than the best batteries. Therefore, taking advantage of the high energy density of chemical fuels to generate power becomes an attractive technological alternative to batteries. To address the growing demand for smaller scale and higher energy density power sources, various combustion-based micro power generators are being developed around the world. This review paper provides an update on recent progresses and developments in micro-scale combustion and micro power generators. The paper, broadly divided into four main sections, begins with a review of various methods to enhance and stabilize the combustion at micro-scale, subsequently improving the efﬁciency. This is followed by a description of various microthermophotovoltaic power generators. The third section focuses on MEMS based solid propellant micropropulsion system. Lastly, a brief review is made to other micro power generators.},

This function, characterizing the magnetic configuration of the actuator, is computed analytically and leads also to an analytical formulation of the magnetic force. In order to achieve extremely fast computation, eddy currents are modeled through a new type of electric equivalent network, derived directly from Maxwell's equations and taking into account the actual BH nonlinearities, moving armature, and device geometry.

abstract = {This work presents a network model to simulate the periodic behavior of a double acting free piston type Stirling engine. Each component of the engine is considered independently and its equivalent electrical circuit derived. When assembled in a global electrical network, a global model of the engine is established. Its steady behavior can be obtained by the analysis of the transfer function for one phase from the piston to the expansion chamber. It is then possible to simulate the dynamic (steady state stroke and operation frequency) as well as the thermodynamic performances (output power and efficiency) for given mean pressure, heat source and heat sink temperatures. The motion amplitude especially can be determined by the spring-mass properties of the moving parts and the main nonlinear effects which are taken into account in the model. The thermodynamic features of the model have then been validated using the classical isothermal Schmidt analysis for a given stroke. A three-phase low temperature differential double acting free membrane architecture has been built and tested. The experimental results are compared with the model and a satisfactory agreement is obtained. The stroke and operating frequency are predicted with less than 2% error whereas the output power discrepancy is of about 30%. Finally, some optimization routes are suggested to improve the design and maximize the performances aiming at waste heat recovery applications.},

@article{Dochat1987,
abstract = {The U.S. Government is evaluating power requirements for future space applications. As power requirements increase, solar or nuclear dynamic systems become increasingly attractive. Free Piston Stirling Engines (FPSE) have the potential to provide high reliability, long life, and efficient operation at reasonable hot-side temperatures. Therefore, they are excellent candidates for the dynamic power conversion module of a space-based, power-generating system. FPSEs are at an early stage of technological development; however, they are recognized as a potential backup and/or growth version within the SP-100 program, which is developing a space power system utilizing a liquid metal nuclear reactor as a heat source and thermoelectric cells for power generation. As part of the SP-100 technology assessment program and the continuing NASA advanced technology development program, Mechanical Technology Incorporated (MTI) was awarded a contract (managed by NASA/Lewis Research Center) to design, fabricate, test, and demonstrate a 25-kWe Space Power Demonstrator Engine (SPDE). Full pressure testing of the SPDE was initiated in November 1985. Initial test results indicated that the SPDE was significantly down in power compared to analytical predictions at the design pressure. The first three months of 1986 were spent performing an extensive diagnostic test series to identify and correct the cause of the power discrepancy. The diagnostic test phase has been completed successfully with a resolution of the SPDE power discrepancy. This paper briefly reviews the SPDE design and presents the experimental results generated to date compared with analytical predictions.},

abstract = {Major challenges of micro thermal machines are the thermal insulation and mechanical tolerance in the case of sliding piston. Replacing piston by membrane in microengines can alleviate the latter and lead to planar architectures. However, the thermal isolation would call for very thick structures which are associated to too high resonant frequencies which are detrimental to the engine performances. A thermal and mechanical compromise is to be made. On the contrary, based on fluid structure interaction, using an incompressible fluid contained in a cavity sealed by deformable diaphragm it would be possible to design a thick, low frequency insulating diaphragm. The design involves a simple planar geometry that is easy to manufacture with standard microelectronics methods. An analytical fluid-structure model is proposed and theoretically validated. Experimental structures are realized and tested. The model is in agreement with the experimental results. A dimensionless model is proposed to design hybrid fluid structures for micromachines.},

The component tests are split into two activities at current stage to separate the effect of the heat transfer from the combustor to the compressor, which was shown to have large effect on the component efficiency, by previous studies. Current objective of the tests is to clarify whether the gas turbine at micro-scale is feasible from the point of performance change due to the scaling effect.

In order to explore the feasibility, to obtain the performance, and to verify the design results of a micro radial turbine, this paper mainly presents the investigation on overall performance of a micro radial turbine with 10 mm diameter for 50W-class micro gas turbine by the cold model test. Firstly, the aerodynamic performance test platform for high speed micro radial turbine was exhibited. Then, the feasibility and overall performance test of micro radial turbine was carried out. At present, the rotational speed of micro radial turbine has achieved at 359,900 rpm by using hydrostatic gas bearing, which is approximately 80% rotational speed of the design point in cold model test. Thirdly, based on the experimental data and numerical simulation, the operating performance and overall performance of the micro gas turbine were analyzed and discussed in details. The final results indicate that the feasibility of the millimeter-scale micro radial turbine with 10 mm diameter has partly been proven at present level and the micro radial turbine system need to be further improved. These works not only obtain the some valuable experimental data, but also accumulate experience of micro radial turbine design. And this paper not only exhibits the test and design results as engineering reference, but also presents the operation problems and its potential solutions of ultra-high rotational speed experiment and performance test of a micro radial turbine.},

abstract = {In this work, a new polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane was synthesized and its sorption, diffusion, and permeation properties were investigated using H2, N2, O2, CH4, CO2, and C3H8 as a function of pressure at 35°C. PDMS, as a rubbery membrane, was confirmed to be more permeable to more condensable gases such as C3H8. The synthesized PDMS membrane showed much better gas permeation performance than others reported in the literature. Based on the sorption data of this study and other researchers' works, some valuable parameters such as Flory-Huggins (FH) interaction parameters, $\chi$, etc., were calculated and discussed. The concentration-averaged FH interaction parameters of H2, N2, O2, CH4, CO2, and C3H8 in the synthesized PDMS membrane were estimated to be 2.196, 0.678, 0.165, 0.139, 0.418, and 0.247, respectively. Chemical similarity of O2, CH4, and C3H8 with backbone structure of PDMS led to lower $\chi$ values or more favorable interactions with polymer matrix, particularly for CH4. Regular solution theory was applied to verify correctness of evaluated interaction parameters. Local effective diffusion coefficient of C3H8 and CO2 increased with increasing penetrant concentration, which indicated the plasticization effect of these gases over the range of penetrant concentration studied. According to high C3H8/gas ideal selectivity values, the synthesized PDMS membrane is recommended as an efficient membrane for the separation of organic vapors from noncondensable gases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {High-efficiency thermoelectric (TE) materials are important for power-generation devices that are designed to convert waste heat into electrical energy.They can also be used in solid-state refrigeration devices.The conversion of waste heat into electrical energy may play an important role in our current challenge to develop alternative energy technologies to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.An overview of various TE phenomena and materials is provided in this issue of MRS Bulletin. Several of the current applications and key parameters are defined and discussed.Novel applications of TE materials include biothermal batteries to power heart pacemakers, enhanced performance of optoelectronics coupled with solid-state TE cooling, and power generation for deep-space probes via radioisotope TE generators.A number of different systems of potential TE materials are currently under investigation by various research groups around the world, and many of these materials are reviewed in the articles in this issue.These range from thin-film superlattice materials to large single-crystal or polycrystalline bulk materials, and from semiconductors and semimetals to ceramic oxides.The phonon-glass/electron-crystal approach to new TE materials is presented, along with the role of solid-state crystal chemistry.Research criteria for developing new materials are highlighted.},

The developed mathematical model is based on the Finite Time Thermodynamics (FFT) approach and it is derived from the differential time dependent equations of energy and mass conservation. The engine model consists of three spaces: compression, expansion and regenerator. In contrast to available models, the model presented in this paper assumes polytropic processes in the compression and expansion spaces, which corresponds to the non-ideal heat transfer in these spaces. The results, obtained using the developed second order model, were compared with the results obtained using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the same engine. A very good agreement between the second order model and the CFD model was achieved. Finally, the developed model was applied to analyse potential to recover cryogenic exergy of the Liqueﬁed Natural Gas (LNG). The paper presents the results of the dimensional upscaling of the engine and the inﬂuence of the average working pressure. It was revealed that increasing the size of the engine or the average working pressure moves the engine to practically unachievable working conditions.},

The turbopump integrates components that are demonstrated for the first time at microscale, such as a four-stage radial planar type microturbine and a one-sided hydrostatic thrust bearing (TB) system, along with a spiral groove viscous pump, a partially grooved seal, and a hydrostatic journal bearing. This paper presents the analytical models developed for each component, including a flow resistance model for the TB and models based on lubrication theory for the pump and seal. They are integrated to enable the microsystem design by satisfying force and power balance conditions on the rotor. Considering our previous thermodynamic cycle analysis on the Rankine micro power generation system, which is aimed at generating a few watts of electric power for applications in portable electronics or waste energy harvesting, we have designed a centimeter-scale demo turbopump device delivering 4.7 W of turbine mechanical power and 71% of turbopump efficiency in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the component design models and system design principles.

abstract = {Throttling and fluid compressibility losses are the major losses which occur during the valve transition in a switched mode hydraulic circuit. To minimize the throttling energy loss, a soft switch concept with lock and release mechanism was introduced by different researchers. In the literature, two different kinds of soft switches, one locking and another passive, were introduced in a hydraulic circuit. Thereafter, experimental validation was reported considering only a locking-type soft switch. But the influence of the passive soft switch on the performance of the hydraulic system was not reported. In this article, how the passive soft switch would affect the system efficiency has been investigated through bond graph model simulation. It has been shown both numerically and experimentally by other researchers that the use of a passive soft switch and a locking mechanism, depending upon configuration, can lead to more than 66.1% reduction in throttling energy loss. In this article, it has been further shown that an additional 3.25% throttling energy is saved when the passive soft switch is discarded from the system and only the locking mechanism is retained. The critical parameters of the locking soft switch have been optimized through multi-run simulation and, thereafter, a relationship between the critical parameters of the locking soft switch and the throttling energy loss of the valve has been obtained by using multiple regression analysis. Also, the variations of energy losses with respect to different valve orifice areas, duty cycles, and pulse width modulation frequencies are investigated through simulation.},

abstract = {Objectives. This in vitro study tested the influence of diverse stress simulation parameters on the fracture strength of all-ceramic three-unit fixed partial dentures (FPDs). Methods. All-ceramic FPDs made of Empress 2 (Ivoclar-Vivadent, FL) were exposed to thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML) with varying loading parameters such as chewing force (amount, frequency), thermal loading, lateral jaw motion, abutment material, artificial periodontium or antagonistic denture. To investigate the influence of the abutment material, human teeth, polymer abutments and alloy abutments were used. Two different TCML devices with pneumatic or weight loading were compared. FPDs without aging were used as a control. Results and Significance. Combined thermal and mechanical loading significantly reduced the FPD fracture resistance from 1832N to 410N. Duplication of chewing frequency, phase load increase or additional lateral movement did not effect the results. Increasing chewing force, artificial periodontium, and antagonist or abutment material reduced the fracture resistance of the tested FPDs. Different devices with weight or pneumatic loading had no significant influence on the loading capacity of the FPDs. Artificial aging should be performed combining thermal cycling with mechanical loading. Simulation of the artificial periodontium, human antagonists and abutments should be included to achieve a significant aging. {\textcopyright} 2005 Academy of Dental Materials.

A promising alternative involves harvesting energy by converting the dynamic jaw movements into electrical energy via the earcanal. The extent that jaw movements distort the earcanal is still unknown, making it difficult to design the appropriate energy harvesting system for the earplug. Moreover, the finite element methods are barely capable to model the behavior of the earcanal distortion because of the complexity of mechanisms that deform the earcanal.

This paper provides a proof of concept for a head-mounted device with a PFC chin strap capable of harvesting energy from jaw movements. An electromechanical model based on the bond graph method is developed to predict the power output of the energy harvesting system. The optimum resistance value of the load and the best stretch ratio in the strap are also determined. A prototype was developed and tested and its performances were compared to the analytical model predictions. The proposed piezoelectric strap mechanism can be added to all types of head-mounted devices to power small-scale electronic devices such as hearing aids, electronic hearing protectors and communication earpieces.},

@article{VanDeVen2014,
abstract = {Switch-mode hydraulic circuits are a theoretically efficient, compact, fast responding, and inexpensive control option. Despite the many potential benefits of switch-mode hydraulic circuits, the control method suffers from large energy losses during transitions of the high-speed valve due to throttling and fluid compressibility. Rannow and Li previously proposed utilizing soft switching to minimize the throttling energy loss (Rannow and Li, "Soft Switching Approach to Reducing Transition Losses in On/Off Hydraulic Valve," J. Dyn. Syst., Measure. Control (in press)). A major challenge of this approach is a locking soft switch that releases quickly and with precise timing, while under load. In this paper, a novel soft switch locking mechanism is presented that utilizes the pressure signal in the switched volume to trigger the release. A dynamic model is developed of three unique soft switch circuits and two control circuits that create a virtually variable displacement pump. The model is used to perform a grid search optimization of the soft switch parameters for the three circuits. The three soft switch circuits reduce the throttling and compressibility energy losses between 49% and 66% compared with the control circuit. The simulation results demonstrated that the soft switch circuits perform as expected for duty cycles and pressures below the design conditions. At higher duty cycles and pressures, the short time the circuit is connected to tank prevented the soft switches from resetting between cycles, preventing proper function. This novel lock and release soft switch mechanism enables soft switching in switch-mode hydraulic circuits, which significantly reduces throttling and compressibility energy losses during valve transitions. Lower losses during valve transition allow the use of slower switching valves, lowering energy consumption, and cost. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},
